# Welcome to Numeric-Prediction of food prices via their commonly associated factors

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on investigating the relationship between food prices and factors commonly thought to influence it, such as crude oil prices, inflation or fertilizer prices. If these relationships do exist, can they be used to predict food prices ? For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from
