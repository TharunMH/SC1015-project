Problem formulation: Numeric prediction of food prices via their commonly associated factors.
FCEC GROUP 1: Stanley Benjamin Yukon, Tharun Mathialagan, Peter Loh Jun Xin
Food is a vital commodity for growth and human survival. With the rising cost of living, we seek to examine the relationship between food and other commodity prices to investigate the degree in which they influence each other and create models to predict food prices.

It is a commonly held belief that the price of food can be impacted by many other things, such as the Price of Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Fertilizer and Inflation.

We seek to determine if these relationships do in fact exist and whether we can create a machine learning model to predict food prices
